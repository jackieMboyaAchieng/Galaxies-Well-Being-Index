# Galaxies-Well-Being-Index
## Data Description
<li> The data contains 80 variables that characterise the demographic and socio-economic situation of 181 galaxies over a period of at most 26 years. </li>
<li>A composite index is given that measures their well-being. However, the demographic and socio-economic variables that influence this index is not known.</li>

## Objective
<ol>
  <li>To determine which variables best explain the variance of the well-being index. </li>
  <li>To etermine the future well-being values of the galaxies. </li>
</ol>

### Files Provided
<ol>
  <li>train.csv: Contains training data with observed well-being index values. </li>
  <li>validation.csv: Contains validation data for predicting future well-being index values.</li>
</ol>
